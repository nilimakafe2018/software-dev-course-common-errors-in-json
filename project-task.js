// Identified syntax errors
//1. "checkInDate": "2024-05-15" : Missing comma between two properties. JSON require comma between key-value pairs.

//2. name: "Alice Johnson", : Missing double quotes, In JSON, key must ne in double quotes. 

//3. "age": undefined, : JSON does not support undefined. JSON support string, number, boolean, null, objects and array.
// we can use null instead of undefined.

// 4. "email": "bob.smith@example" : Invalid email address. Should be bob.smith@example.com

// 5. "amenities": ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking",] : Extra commas after "Parking". Must be "Parking" without a comma after it.

// I use https://jsonlint.com/ for json validator. 

// Corrected JSON is in "corrected-project-task.json" file and after checking my JSON, I got a message saying "JSON is valid!".
